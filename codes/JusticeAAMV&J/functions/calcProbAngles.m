function [alphas,betas] = calcProbAngles(file1,file2,a,b,t)
% Calculate probability of looking each possible person given thresholds
%% output
% a: vector with the final probabilities of person 1 (file1) looking at 
%   person 2 (file2)
% b: vector with the final probabilities of person 2 (file2) looking at
%   person 1 (file1)
%% input:
% f1: file text 1 with features of person1.
% f2: file text 2 with features of person2.
% alphas: vector with initial known looks of person1.
% betas: vector with initial known looks of person2.
